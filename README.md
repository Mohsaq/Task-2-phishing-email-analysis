📝 **Task 2 - Phishing Email Analysis**

🎯 **Objective**



Analyze a suspicious email to identify phishing characteristics and improve awareness of common email-based threats.



**Sample Email Used**



Subject: Action Required - Your Account Will Be Deactivated

Body:



Dear user,



We’ve detected suspicious activity in your account. Please verify your identity immediately to avoid permanent deactivation.



Click below to verify:  

👉 http://secure-verify-login.com



If you don’t take action within 24 hours, your account will be terminated.



Thank you,  

Security Team  

support@fake-security-alert.com





🔍 **Phishing Indicators Identified**



* Fake Sender Email

The email is from support@fake-security-alert.com, which is not a trusted or verified domain.



* Urgent Language

Phrases like “Your account will be deactivated” and “within 24 hours” pressure the user to act quickly.



* Generic Greeting

Uses “Dear user” instead of a personalized name, indicating it's a mass phishing attempt.



* Suspicious Link

The link http://secure-verify-login.com is fake and does not belong to a real organization.



* Poor Grammar/Structure

The sentence flow and tone seem robotic or auto-generated.



* Mismatched Identity

Claims to be from a security team, but the domain does not belong to any known or credible brand.



* Request for Action

It asks the user to click a link and provide sensitive information.





✅ **Conclusion**



This email contains multiple classic signs of phishing: a fake sender, urgency, impersonal greeting, suspicious link, and a request for action.

Such emails should never be clicked and must be reported immediately.



🧰 **Tools Used**



* Manual analysis
* Awareness of phishing red flags and security practices.
